PART1:
correlated error, find out using autocorrelation in matlab.
The errors have correlation, this can be observed in the autocorrelation plot when zoomed in at the shifting point. 
The error have a correlation in the nearest samples around this area. If it did not, the unshifted error would be just a spike with no correlation in the adjacent samples (Shown in plot as red).
That is, the wider peak of the error shows that there is a correlation between errors in the antecedent and subsequential samples.

PART2:
X1: 803525.650791667
Y1: 6309304.47301000

Since the formula for calculating the speed is s = ((p1+e1)-(p2+e2)/t). The difference between the errors will be very small because of correlation and will therefore almost cancel eachother out.
In comparison to position p = (x+ex, y+ey)

var1 = 306
var2 = 2.664
